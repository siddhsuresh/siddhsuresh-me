<!--
Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.
To make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible please:
 - Link issue via "Closes #[issue_number]
 - Choose & follow the right checklist for the change that you're making:

Please make sure to add a changeset. Run `pnpm changeset` in the root directory to do so.
Then select updated Blitz packages when prompted, and add a short message describing the changes. 
The message should be user-facing â€” explain **what** was changed, not **how**.
Ignore if there are no user-facing changes.

```bash
::set-output name=folders::["auth","get-initial-props","middleware","no-suspense","qm","react-query-utils","rpc","trailing-slash"]
Warning: The `set-output` command is deprecated and will be disabled soon. Please upgrade to using Environment Files. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/
