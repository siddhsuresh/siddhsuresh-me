### What are the changes and their implications?

- [x] Change the server-token given to the ```felixmosh/turborepo-gh-artifacts@v1``` GitHub action from secret value to pre-defined random 36 hex value generated by ```openssl```.

This is requested to be changed as GitHub only allows actions triggered from within the repository the access the secrets defined in the repository, with the exception of the ```GITHUB_TOKEN```

So, whenever a fork triggers the action the windows test fails most of the time due to an exit of a test as the remote caching feature of turbo is not enabled due to a null string being passed as the server-token argument
