‚¨ÜÔ∏è Build and test speeds after first run

- [x] **TODO: Add ```TURBO_SERVER_TOKEN``` to GitHub secrets in order to enable the remote caching using GitHub artifacts**

#### Bug Fixes to enable the tests in windows
- [x] Fixed error in generation of route name for **nested routes** in ```@blitzjs/rpc``` in ```packages/blitz-rpc/src/loader-utils.ts```
```js
  return filePath
    .replace(/^.*?[\\/]queries[\\/]/, "/")
    .replace(/^.*?[\\/]mutations[\\/]/, "/")
    .replace(/\\/g, "/") üëàüèº
    .replace(fileExtensionRegex, "")
```
##### Before in windows

‚ÄºÔ∏è**The ```"/v2\getCurrentUser"``` gets converted to ```/v2getCurrentUser``` in windows which causes the routePath in the resolverMap in ```blitz-rpc/index-server.ts``` not to match when users are using nested paths.**

##### After in windows

- [x] Remove ```NODE_ENV=production``` from the build scripts of the ```apps/*``` as it is not supported in windows [next build will set the NODE_ENV as production by default]

- [x] Update the ```index.test.ts``` file in ```integration-tests/auth``` from explicitly calling the ```seed``` function to now adding the ```prisma reset``` and ```prisma db seed``` commands to the ```package.json```. 
‚ùìThe seed function previously called from the test file was not updating the database, causing the test to fail in windows.
- [x] Increasing the hookTimeout time in the ```integration-tests/react-query-utils/vitest.config.ts``` file to pass the tests in windows
