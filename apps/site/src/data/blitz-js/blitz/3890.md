### What are the changes and their implications?

- [x] migrated ```routes``` cli command from legacy blitz to blitz toolkit
- [x] fix ```getDbFolder``` function in ```packages/blitz/src/cli/utils/next-console.ts``` command  to only check for ```db/schema.prisma``` if schema path defined by ```package.json``` does not exist.
The previous version would return ```db``` regardless if the user stores the schema.prisma file was present or if the user intended another to use the ```db``` folder for any other purpose 
- [x] matched ```blitz routes``` output to the docs https://blitzjs.com/docs/cli-routes
