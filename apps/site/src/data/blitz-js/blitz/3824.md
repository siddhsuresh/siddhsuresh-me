### What are the changes and their implications?

> Creating this only due to continuous failures in workflow especially in windows, sometimes due to core dumps or just exiting randomly. The tests will be run in parallel in GitHub actions as separate jobs rather than in the turbo command, which actually decreases the time taken to complete the tests from almost 7-10 mins to under 5 mins [while testing without cache]. 
I shall close this if deemed unnecessary. 

- [x] split test job in the workflow into 1) Unit tests & 2) Integration tests
- [x] Taking inspiration from https://github.com/philips-labs/list-folder-action/blob/main/action.yml and creating another job to search the integration-tests folder to pass on as the argument of the Integration-test matrix
- [x] Running each integration test separately using the above-passed list of subdirectories and running only those tests using the ```--filter``` argument in-built in turbo cli https://turborepo.org/docs/core-concepts/filtering.
- [x] Caching only build and lint jobs while making each test run without a cache.
- [x] fix auth test for windows as it is the only test that fails even separately. 

##### Pros:
- Runs the test suite successfully in both windows and Linux

##### Cons:
- Increases the GitHub actions usage from 11mins [current usage] to 40-45 mins [with cache with build and lint steps] and 50 mins-1 hour [after removing cache completely] - https://github.com/siddhsuresh/blitz/actions/runs/3034971030 - PR for that https://github.com/siddhsuresh/blitz/pull/45 - If needed
> Mentioning this as I am not sure whether this would cause problems.
