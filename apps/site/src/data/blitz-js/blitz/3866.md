Closes: #3748

### What are the changes and their implications?

- [x] add type BlitzServerConfig for the types used in the ```blitz-server.ts``` config
- [x] create a new command ```blitz generate custom-templates```  that generates the default templates present in the ```@blitzjs/generator``` to provide an easy starting point for the developer to use the custom templates feature 
   - getting custom template path from the user and using that to save the templates
   - updating the ```app/blitz-sever``` file with the required changes needed to use custom templates
- [x] read the named export ```cliConfig``` exported from ```app/blitz-server.{ts|js}``` and use the ```customTemplates``` property to pass the custom template path
