Closes: #2162

### What are the changes and their implications?

- [x] Allow opt-in configuration to use GET requests than POST for ```query``` files [ ```mutations``` even with this config will only use POST requests]

#### Example Usage
```ts
export const config: ResolverConfig = {
  httpMethod: "GET",
}
```
- [x] Show warning to the user if URL length exceeds 2083 characters which is the minimum of the maximum URL limit set by browsers (IE and Edge 16) 
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/417142/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-url-in-different-browsers/417184#417184 
  - https://wiert.me/2010/04/20/maximum-url-lengths/

But, there is no practical limit for URL size for the latest browsers. So, should the warning be removed?
- [x] Update the ```rpc``` tests to accept GET requests 
- [x] Remove updates to toolkit app - currently present to test

#### TODO:
 - [x] Replace `esbuild` usage with `jscodeshift` to get the config from the files

- [x] try shifting to `swc` from `recast` to improve performance 
- [x]  Remove caching layer as it is not needed anymore

#### Output
(Where GET request has been set for ```getProject``` and the default POST request set for ```getProjects```
